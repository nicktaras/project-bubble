# project-bubble


Project Bubble is an app for managing projects.

### Plan of Action

Tasks:

- [Easy] CSS: Add hand cursor to drag and drop items (easiest task).
- [Medium] html: Add a form to the page edit-task.html, with the same fields as the 'Add new task' modal.
- [Hard] Html: (a bit tricky, but if you understand how 'Add new task' works you will complete this). New edit modal
- Bonus - Open button - link to open page html file

Steps to do the harder task:
part 1: project-overview.html - Copy the html for the modal made for 'Add new task'
part 2: paste it into the page next to the 'Add new task modal'
part 3: add a click event, similar to how the 'Add new task modal' works, but it should open when someone clicks edit task.
